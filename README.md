# Smart Contract Auditing 

Public repository/archive featuring Solidity smart contracts that I audited.

## Do you need an audit for your project?

That's great! But first, read the checklist below to understand if you are ready to do an audit.

## Am I ready for an audit?

**Essentials**

- Smart contracts are feature complete
- Scope is well defined (which contracts you want to audit, and how many lines of code)
- Unit tests are implemented and run successfully
- High test coverage
- Documentation about the project
- Code freeze, until the auditing process is finished

**Good to have**

- Commented code, highlighting features and expectations

## Checklist passed, I'm ready

Contact me through my [website](https://davidematta.dev/contact) and we can have a talk about your project!
